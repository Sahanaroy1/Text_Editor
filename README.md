# Just_Another_Text_Editor

## User Story
* As a developer this week's project is to develop a Single Page Application that meets PWA criteria. It will also feature some data persistence technique serving redundancy incase any option not supported by the browser.

* It should run offline. It will store data in IndexedDB database.It should use idb package. It also features some methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data. Text editor is also another good project which I can showcase.

## Acceptance Criteria
* It's done when I open the application in visual studio code I see the client server folder.
* It's done when npm run start:dev is given in the terminal after npm install the application starts the backend and serves the client.
* It's done when the text editor is run from the terminal I can see the javascipt files bundled up using webpack.
* It's done when the webpack plugins are run I can see the HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
* It's done when the nex-gen Javascript is being used I can see text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
* It's done when you open the text editor in localhost:3000 you can see the IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
* It's done when the content is entered and subsequently clicked off of the DOM window then the content is being saved in the IndexedDB.
* It's done when the text editor is reopened the content is retrieved from the IndexedDB.
* It's done when the install me is being clicked then the application is downloaded as an icon on the mac screen.
* It's done when the application is loaded then i have the registered service worker using workbox.
